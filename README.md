Pattern change anomaly
Volatility shift anomaly detector
Anomaly detection by threshold method
Three different methods
Anomaly detection GENERAL CASE & METHODS
Exploratory data analysis
Three different approaches
Approach 1. Move, smoothe, evaluate
    1.Rolling window estimations
    2.Exponential smoothing, Holt-Winters model
    3.Time-series cross validation, parameters selection


Approach 2. Econometric approach- ARIMA
    1.Stationarity, unit root
    2.Getting rid of non-stationarity
    3.SARIMA intuition and model building


Approach 3. Linear (and not quite) models on time series
    1.Feature extraction
    2.Linear models, feature importance
    3.Regularization, feature selection
    4.XGBoost
Conclusion and future work
